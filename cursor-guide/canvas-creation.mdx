## What are Obsidian Canvases?

Obsidian Canvas is a visual workspace where you can:
- Arrange notes spatially
- Draw connections between ideas
- Create mind maps and diagrams
- Plan projects visually
- Build knowledge maps

## Why Use Cursor to Create Canvases?

Creating canvases manually can be time-consuming. Cursor can:
- Generate entire canvases from descriptions
- Auto-arrange nodes logically
- Create connections automatically
- Build complex diagrams in seconds

<Info>
  **Canvas files** are JSON files with `.canvas` extension that Obsidian renders visually.
</Info>

## Canvas File Structure

A basic canvas file looks like this:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "node-1",
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Central Idea",
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0,
      "width": 250,
      "height": 60,
      "color": "1"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "edge-1",
      "fromNode": "node-1",
      "toNode": "node-2"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
  You don't need to understand JSON! Just tell Cursor what you want, and it handles the technical details.
</Tip>

## Basic Canvas Creation

### Simple Example: Family Tree

**Your prompt:**
```
Create a canvas file called "Family-Tree.canvas" showing:

- Central node: "Our Family"
- Parent nodes: "Mom" and "Dad"
- Child nodes: "Me", "Sister", "Brother"
- Connect parents to "Our Family"
- Connect children to "Our Family"

Arrange in a tree structure.
```

**What Cursor creates:**
- JSON file with proper structure
- Nodes positioned logically
- Connections (edges) between related nodes
- Ready to open in Obsidian!

### Project Planning Canvas

**Your prompt:**
```
Create "Project-Plan.canvas" with these elements:

Main project node in center: "Court Case Preparation"

Four surrounding areas:
1. Research (top)
   - Nodes: Legal Standards, Case Law, Procedures
2. Evidence (right)
   - Nodes: Documents, Timeline, Witnesses
3. Strategy (bottom)
   - Nodes: Key Arguments, Counterarguments, Presentation
4. Tasks (left)
   - Nodes: Immediate, This Week, This Month

Connect each area to the center.
Color code: Research=blue, Evidence=green, Strategy=red, Tasks=yellow
```

## Advanced Canvas Prompts

### Timeline Canvas

**For legal cases, project management, historical events:**

```
Create "Case-Timeline.canvas" showing events chronologically:

Read these notes:
@event1.md
@event2.md
@event3.md

For each event, create a node with:
- Date as title
- Brief description
- Link to the source note

Arrange horizontally (left=oldest, right=newest)
Connect nodes with arrows showing progression
Add milestone markers at key decision points
```

### Mind Map Canvas

**For brainstorming, research synthesis:**

```
Create "Research-Map.canvas" as a mind map:

Central topic: "Child Custody Research"

Main branches:
- Legal Rights (with sub-branches from @LegalRights/ notes)
- Best Practices (with sub-branches from @BestPractices/ notes)
- Case Studies (with sub-branches from @CaseStudies/ notes)
- Resources (with sub-branches from @Resources/ notes)

Auto-generate sub-branches based on note titles in each folder
Color code main branches differently
Arrange radially around center
```

### Argument Structure Canvas

**For court preparation, essay planning:**

```
Create "Argument-Structure.canvas" showing:

Top: Main Claim
  "I should have 50-50 custody"

Second level: Supporting Arguments (3 nodes)
  - "Child's best interest"
  - "My capability as parent"
  - "Historical involvement"

Third level: Evidence for each argument
  (Create nodes from @Evidence/ folder, connecting to relevant arguments)

Bottom level: Responses to counter-arguments
  (Create nodes from @Counterarguments/ folder)

Arrange as hierarchy top-to-bottom
Use green for strengths, yellow for areas to address
```

## Node Types

Canvases support different node types:

## Styling & Layout

### Colors

Obsidian Canvas supports 6 colors (numbered 1-6):

**Prompt example:**
```
Create nodes and color them:

- Completed tasks: color 2 (orange)
- In-progress: color 3 (yellow)
- Resources: color 4 (green)
- Ideas: color 5 (blue)
- Questions: color 6 (purple)
```

### Positioning

You can specify layouts:

**Grid Layout:**
```
Arrange nodes in a 3x3 grid
Spacing: 300 pixels horizontal, 200 pixels vertical
Top-left corner at x:0, y:0
```

**Circular Layout:**
```
Arrange 8 nodes in a circle
Center at x:400, y:400
Radius: 300 pixels
```

**Hierarchical Layout:**
```
Arrange as tree structure:
- Root at top center
- Children below, spread horizontally
- 3 levels deep
- 150px vertical spacing between levels
```

## Real-World Examples

## Converting Notes to Canvas

You can transform existing notes into visual canvases:

**Prompt:**
```
Read @ProjectNotes.md and create a canvas visualization:

- Main headings become primary nodes
- Bullet points become child nodes
- Links between notes become edges
- Arrange as mind map radiating from center

Call it "Project-Visual.canvas"
```

## Batch Canvas Creation

Create multiple canvases at once:

**Prompt:**
```
For each note in @People/ folder, create a canvas showing:
- Person's name as central node
- Related documents as surrounding nodes
- Connections they have to other people
- Timeline of interactions

Name each canvas "[PersonName]-Network.canvas"
Save in @Canvases/ folder
```

## Interactive Development

Build canvases iteratively:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Simple">
    ```
    Create a basic canvas with 5 nodes for main topics
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review in Obsidian">
    Open the canvas, see what you like/don't like
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine in Cursor">
    ```
    Add sub-nodes for each main topic
    Color code by priority
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Details">
    ```
    Link each node to corresponding notes in my vault
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Canvas won't open in Obsidian">
    **Solution:**
    - Check file has `.canvas` extension
    - Verify JSON is valid (ask Cursor to validate)
    - Make sure it's inside your vault folder
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Nodes are overlapping">
    **Solution:**
    Ask Cursor to reposition:
    ```
    Spread out the nodes more - give 400px spacing between them
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Links don't work">
    **Solution:**
    Make sure file paths are correct:
    ```
    Update all file node paths to match actual note locations in my vault
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too cluttered">
    **Solution:**
    Simplify:
    ```
    Reduce to just top-level nodes, remove sub-details
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
