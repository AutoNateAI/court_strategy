## What is Cursor?

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on VS Code that helps you write code, automate tasks, and build tools using natural language. While it's designed for programming, it's perfect for non-coders who want to harness AI for productivity.

## What Can You Do with Cursor?

### 1. Generate Obsidian Canvases
Ask Cursor to create visual mind maps and diagrams for your Obsidian vault.

**Example prompt:**
```
Create an Obsidian canvas file that shows a family tree
with nodes for each family member and connections between them.
```

### 2. Batch Process Notes
Transform multiple notes at once with AI assistance.

**Example:**
```
Read all notes in my "Research" folder and create
a summary document with key insights.
```

### 3. Create Templates
Generate sophisticated note templates automatically.

**Example:**
```
Create a daily planning template that includes:
- Morning routine checklist
- Top 3 priorities
- Time blocks
- Evening reflection
```

### 4. Analyze Your Vault
Get insights from your notes using AI.

**Example:**
```
Analyze all my case notes and create a timeline
of events with links to source documents.
```

## Common Concerns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm not technical. Can I really use this?">
    **Absolutely!** That's the whole point. Cursor's AI does the technical work. You just describe what you want in plain English. Our workshops are specifically designed for non-technical users.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my data safe?">
    **Yes.** Your files stay on your computer. Cursor sends your prompts to AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic) but not your entire vault. You can also use local models for complete privacy.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need to pay for Cursor?">
    **There's a free tier** with limited AI requests. For heavy use, Cursor Pro is $20/month. You can also use your own OpenAI/Anthropic API keys.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will I break my Obsidian vault?">
    **No.** Always back up your vault first (as you should anyway!). Cursor creates and edits regular markdown files - nothing that can corrupt your vault. If something goes wrong, you can undo or restore from backup.
  </Accordion>
