## Opening Your Vault in Cursor

The first step to using Cursor with Obsidian is opening your vault folder:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Cursor">
    Open Cursor application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Folder">
    **File → Open Folder** (or `Cmd/Ctrl + K, Cmd/Ctrl + O`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Vault">
    Browse to your Obsidian vault folder location:
    - Usually in Documents folder
    - Look for the folder you named when creating the vault
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Open">
    Cursor will load your entire vault in the file explorer
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Keep Both Open:** Run Obsidian and Cursor side-by-side. Changes in one appear instantly in the other!
</Tip>

## Understanding the Workspace

Once your vault is open, you'll see:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="File Explorer">
    ### Left Sidebar: File Explorer
    
    - All your vault folders and files
    - Same structure as in Obsidian
    - Click any `.md` file to open it
    - Right-click for more options
    
    <Info>
      Files with `.md` extension are your notes
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Editor">
    ### Center: Editor
    
    - Edit markdown files directly
    - See your notes as plain text
    - Syntax highlighting for markdown
    - Edit multiple files in tabs
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="AI Chat">
    ### Right Sidebar: AI Chat
    
    - Press `Cmd/Ctrl + L` to open
    - Ask AI questions about your vault
    - Request file modifications
    - Generate new content
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Working with Markdown Files

Obsidian uses markdown (`.md`) files. Here's what they look like in Cursor:

```markdown
# My Note Title

This is a regular paragraph with [[Wiki Links]] to other notes.

- Bullet point
- Another point

## Section Header

You can use #tags and **bold** and *italic* text.

![[Embedded Image.png]]
```

<Accordion title="Understanding Obsidian Syntax">
  **Internal Links:**
  - `[[Note Name]]` - Links to another note
  - `[[Note Name|Display Text]]` - Link with custom text
  - `[[Note Name#Heading]]` - Link to specific section
  
  **Embeds:**
  - `![[Note Name]]` - Embeds another note
  - `![[Image.png]]` - Embeds an image
  
  **Tags:**
  - `#tag` - Single word tag
  - `#multi-word-tag` - Multi-word tag
</Accordion>

## Basic AI Tasks

### Task 1: Ask About Your Vault

Open AI chat (`Cmd/Ctrl + L`) and try:

```
What notes do I have in my vault related to family planning?
```

The AI will scan your vault and list relevant notes.

### Task 2: Summarize a Note

Open a note, then ask in chat:

```
Summarize this note in 3 bullet points
```

### Task 3: Create a New Note

In the chat, ask:

```
Create a new note called "Weekly Review Template.md" in my Templates folder
with sections for: Wins, Challenges, Next Week Goals
```

AI will create the file for you!

## Advanced: Using @mentions

Tell AI which files to focus on using @mentions:

<Accordion title="@mention Syntax">
  **Reference specific files:**
  ```
  @filename.md analyze the timeline in this note
  ```
  
  **Reference folders:**
  ```
  @foldername/ summarize all notes in this folder
  ```
  
  **Reference codebase:**
  ```
  @codebase find all notes mentioning "custody"
  ```
</Accordion>

## Practical Workflows

### Workflow 1: Daily Note Creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open AI Chat">
    Press `Cmd/Ctrl + L`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Daily Note">
    ```
    Create today's daily note in my Daily Notes folder.
    Use format: YYYY-MM-DD.md
    Include: weather prompt, gratitude section, top 3 tasks, journal area
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open in Obsidian">
    Switch to Obsidian - your new note is there!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Workflow 2: Batch Rename Files

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe What You Want">
    ```
    Rename all files in my "Research" folder to use 
    YYYY-MM-DD prefix format based on their creation date
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Changes">
    AI will show you what it plans to do
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve">
    Type "yes" to proceed or request modifications
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Workflow 3: Extract Information

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open AI Chat">
    With your vault open in Cursor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask for Extraction">
    ```
    @Research/ Read all notes in the Research folder and 
    create a new note called "Key Findings.md" that lists 
    the most important insights from each note
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Output">
    AI creates the summary note with links back to sources
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Canvas Files

Canvas files (`.canvas`) are JSON files. Cursor can create and edit them!

<Accordion title="Canvas File Structure">
  A canvas file looks like this:
  ```json
  {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "unique-id",
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Node content",
        "x": 0,
        "y": 0,
        "width": 250,
        "height": 60
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "id": "edge-id",
        "fromNode": "node1-id",
        "toNode": "node2-id"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

### Creating a Canvas

Ask AI in chat:

```
Create a canvas file called "Project Overview.canvas" with:
- Central node: "Main Project"
- 4 surrounding nodes: "Research", "Planning", "Execution", "Review"
- Connect all to center
```

More on this in the [Canvas Creation guide](/cursor-guide/canvas-creation).

## Inline Editing with Cmd+K

Highlight any text in a note and press `Cmd/Ctrl + K`:

**Example 1: Expand Text**
- Highlight: "Need to research schools"
- Press `Cmd/K`
- Type: "Expand this into a detailed checklist"
- AI rewrites the selection

**Example 2: Reformat**
- Highlight: Messy list of items
- Press `Cmd/K`
- Type: "Format as a markdown table"
- AI converts to table

**Example 3: Improve Writing**
- Highlight: Rough draft paragraph
- Press `Cmd/K`
- Type: "Make this more professional"
- AI rewrites it

## Using Composer for Complex Tasks

Composer (`Cmd/Ctrl + I`) is for generating entire files or making multi-file changes:

<Accordion title="When to Use Composer">
  **Use Composer when:**
  - Creating new files from scratch
  - Making changes across multiple files
  - Building complex structures (like canvas files)
  - Generating templates
  
  **Use Chat when:**
  - Asking questions
  - Analyzing existing content
  - Getting advice
  - Understanding your notes
  
  **Use Cmd+K when:**
  - Editing specific text selections
  - Quick rewrites
  - Formatting changes
  - Inline improvements
</Accordion>

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Timeline from Meeting Notes

**You have:** 5 meeting notes with scattered date references

**Cursor chat:**
```
@Meetings/ Read all meeting notes and create a timeline document
showing when each decision was made, with links back to the 
source meeting notes. Sort chronologically.
```

**Result:** Complete timeline with clickable links

### Example 2: Contact Database

**You have:** Person notes scattered across folders

**Cursor chat:**
```
Find all notes with contact information and create a 
"Contact Directory.md" with a table showing: 
Name, Role, Email, Phone, Link to full note
```

**Result:** Organized contact list

### Example 3: Tag Cleanup

**You have:** Inconsistent tags (#urgent, #Urgent, #URGENT)

**Cursor chat:**
```
Find all variations of the "urgent" tag in my vault and 
standardize them to #urgent (lowercase)
```

**Result:** Consistent tagging system

## Terminal Commands

Cursor has a built-in terminal for advanced operations:

<Accordion title="Useful Terminal Commands">
  **Open Terminal:** Press `` Cmd/Ctrl + ` ``
  
  **Find all notes with tag:**
  ```bash
  grep -r "#tagname" .
  ```
  
  **Count notes:**
  ```bash
  find . -name "*.md" | wc -l
  ```
  
  **List recently modified:**
  ```bash
  ls -lt **/*.md | head -10
  ```
  
  <Info>
    Ask AI to explain any terminal command you don't understand!
  </Info>
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Changes not showing in Obsidian">
    **Solution:**
    - Obsidian auto-reloads but sometimes needs a manual refresh
    - Close and reopen the note in Obsidian
    - Check if the file was saved in Cursor (auto-save should handle this)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="AI can't find my notes">
    **Solution:**
    - Make sure vault folder is open (not just a single file)
    - Try using @mentions to specify files/folders
    - Check if files are actually `.md` extension
    - Large vaults may need more specific queries
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="AI breaks my links">
    **Solution:**
    - Be explicit: "Keep all [[wiki links]] intact"
    - Review changes before accepting
    - Use Obsidian's link detection to fix broken links
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performance is slow">
    **Solution:**
    - Close tabs you're not using
    - Work on specific folders instead of entire vault
    - Consider splitting very large vaults
    - Use faster AI models for simple tasks
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security & Privacy

<Warning>
  **What gets sent to AI:**
  - Your prompts
  - Files you @mention
  - Open files in your workspace (for context)
  
  **What doesn't:**
  - Your entire vault automatically
  - Closed files (unless you mention them)
  - Files in .gitignore (if configured)
</Warning>

### For Sensitive Information

If you're working with sensitive family or legal documents:

1. **Use local models** (no internet required) - Advanced setup
2. **Use your own API keys** (more privacy control)
3. **Be selective with @mentions** - Only share what's needed
4. **Consider separate vaults** - Keep sensitive info separate
