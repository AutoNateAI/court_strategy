## What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is simply how you communicate with AI. Think of it as giving instructions to a very capable assistant who needs clear direction.

<Info>
  **Good news:** You don't need to learn special syntax or commands. Natural language works great!
</Info>

## Anatomy of a Good Prompt

The best prompts have three elements:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Context" icon="map">
    What is the situation?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Task" icon="list-check">
    What do you want done?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Format" icon="table">
    How should the output look?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example Breakdown

**Bad prompt:**
```
Organize notes
```

**Good prompt:**
```
Context: I have meeting notes scattered across my vault
Task: Create a summary document of all meetings from January 2024
Format: Use a table with columns: Date, Attendees, Key Decisions, Action Items
```

## Prompt Templates for Obsidian

### Creating Content

**Template: New Note from Description**
```
Create a new note called "[NAME].md" in the [FOLDER] folder.

Include these sections:
- [Section 1]
- [Section 2]
- [Section 3]

Use YAML frontmatter with: date, tags, status
```

**Example:**
```
Create a new note called "School Visit - Oak Elementary.md" 
in the Education folder.

Include these sections:
- First Impressions
- Facilities
- Teachers Met
- Pros and Cons
- Next Steps

Use YAML frontmatter with: date, tags: [education, school], status: needs-review
```

### Analyzing Content

**Template: Summarization**
```
@[filename.md] Read this note and create a summary that:
- Highlights the [X] most important points
- Is written in [tone: professional/casual/etc]
- Is approximately [X] sentences/paragraphs long
- Includes links to related topics if mentioned
```

**Example:**
```
@legal-meeting-notes.md Read this note and create a summary that:
- Highlights the 5 most important points
- Is written in a clear, professional tone
- Is approximately 1 paragraph long
- Includes links to any people or documents mentioned
```

### Organizing & Restructuring

**Template: Batch Organization**
```
@[folder]/ Look at all notes in this folder and:
1. [What to analyze]
2. [What to create/change]
3. [How to format the result]

Make sure to [specific requirement]
```

**Example:**
```
@Research/ Look at all notes in this folder and:
1. Identify the main topics covered
2. Create a "Research Index.md" file that lists all notes by topic
3. Format as a markdown outline with links to each note

Make sure to preserve all original filenames exactly
```

### Data Extraction

**Template: Information Gathering**
```
Search through [location] and find all instances of [what you're looking for].

Create a new note called "[name]" with:
- [Format specification]
- [What to include]
- [What to exclude]

Sort by [criteria]
```

**Example:**
```
Search through my entire vault and find all instances of deadlines or due dates.

Create a new note called "All Deadlines.md" with:
- A table showing: Task, Deadline, Source Note, Status
- Only include future dates
- Exclude completed items

Sort by date (soonest first)
```

## Advanced Prompt Techniques

### Technique 1: Chain of Thought

For complex tasks, break it into steps:

```
I want to organize my family vault. Here's my plan:

Step 1: Scan all notes and identify which ones mention health, education, or legal topics
Step 2: Create index notes for each category
Step 3: Add links in the index to relevant notes
Step 4: Add backlinks in each note to its category index

Start with Step 1 and show me what you find. 
Wait for my approval before moving to Step 2.
```

<Tip>
  Breaking complex tasks into steps gives you control and better results
</Tip>

### Technique 2: Provide Examples

Show AI what you want:

```
Create meeting notes for today's school visit.

Format them like this example:

# Meeting: [Name]
Date: 2024-01-15
Attendees: [[Person 1]], [[Person 2]]

## Discussion
- Topic 1
- Topic 2

## Decisions
- Decision 1

## Action Items
- [ ] Task for [[Person]]

Use this exact format for "School Visit - Oak Elementary" 
that happened today with Mrs. Johnson.
```

### Technique 3: Specify Constraints

Tell AI what NOT to do:

```
Create a summary of all my research notes.

Requirements:
- DO include key findings and sources
- DO use markdown formatting
- DON'T change any [[wiki links]]
- DON'T modify the original notes
- DON'T remove any tags
- Maximum length: 2 pages
```

### Technique 4: Iterative Refinement

Start broad, then refine:

```
First prompt: "Summarize my meeting notes from last week"
→ Review output

Second prompt: "Good, but make it more detailed and add action items"
→ Review output

Third prompt: "Perfect, now format as a table instead"
→ Final result
```

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mistake: Too Vague">
    **Bad:** "Fix my notes"
    
    **Better:** "Read notes in @Family/ folder and ensure all have YAML frontmatter with date and tags fields"
    
    **Why:** AI needs to know exactly what "fix" means
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mistake: Too Many Tasks at Once">
    **Bad:** "Organize everything, create indexes, fix tags, and generate summaries"
    
    **Better:** "First, create an index of all notes in @Research/ grouped by topic"
    
    **Why:** One task at a time produces better results
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mistake: No Context">
    **Bad:** "Summarize this"
    
    **Better:** "@meeting-notes.md Summarize this meeting note for someone who wasn't there, focusing on decisions and action items"
    
    **Why:** Context helps AI understand your goal
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mistake: Assuming AI Remembers">
    **Bad:** "Now do the same for the other files" (in a new chat)
    
    **Better:** Repeat the full instruction with new file names
    
    **Why:** Each prompt should be self-contained
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
