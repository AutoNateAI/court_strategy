## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Obsidian won't open on macOS">
    **Solution:** Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, and click "Open Anyway" next to the Obsidian warning.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find my vault">
    **Solution:** Vaults are just folders. Look for the folder name you created during setup. Default location is usually in your Documents folder.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slow performance">
    **Solution:** Large vaults (10,000+ notes) may be slower. Consider splitting into multiple vaults or disabling resource-intensive plugins.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mobile app won't sync">
    **Solution:** Make sure you're using the same sync method (Obsidian Sync, iCloud, etc.) on all devices and that the vault folder is in the right location.
