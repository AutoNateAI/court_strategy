## What is Obsidian?

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge management application that helps you organize your thoughts, research, and information in a connected, visual way. Unlike traditional note-taking apps, Obsidian treats your notes as a network of interconnected ideas - just like your brain works.

## Core Concepts

### The Vault

Your **vault** is simply a folder on your computer where Obsidian stores all your notes. Each vault is self-contained and can be backed up, synced, or shared easily.

```
My Vault/
├── Daily Notes/
├── Projects/
├── Resources/
└── Templates/
```

### Notes and Links

Notes in Obsidian are plain text files with `.md` extension (Markdown format). The magic happens when you link notes together:

```markdown
This is a note about [[Obsidian]]. It connects to my notes on [[Knowledge Management]] and [[PKM]].

When I learn about [[AI Tools]], I can link them back here too.
```

### The Graph View

See your entire knowledge base as an interactive graph. Watch your second brain grow!

<Tip>
  The graph view is especially powerful for discovering unexpected connections in your research.
